## Attendr

This is the front end of our Makers Academy Final Project, Attendr. Attendr is an events driven dating platform which matches people based on events they are both interested in.

The front end for our iOS application is written in Swift 3. This part of the application is reliant on our cloud server, written in NodeJS.

You can find the source code to our Backend Github Repository here:  [Link](https://github.com/littlethao/attendr-server.git)

## Future to-dos

Given that we had 8 days to build this iOS application with a new language and within a new environment, I am impressed by the final product we have build together and were happy to present on graduation day.

- TDD in xCode

#### Future features
